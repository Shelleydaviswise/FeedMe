# Feed Me
A Dot net MVC application for choosing and saving recipes based on dietary preferences and other search criteria.

###User Story
As a client of this site, when I logon I want to search the API for recipes that align with any dietary restrictions I may have.  Once I choose the type of recipe I want, I want to further search those results for a subset of requirements i.e. genre of food or ethnic origin.

As a user, when I have selected the type of recipe I desire, I want those recipes to populate a place on the screen for me to inspect them.

After displaying a subset of recipes, I want to be able to select recipes I want to try and save those recipes to a database.  (Recipe Box)

As a user, when I display my selected recipes, I want to be able to make adjustments to the recipe and save those changes if desired or Delete the recipe if it is no longer desired. 

Optional features once MVP is reached.
- Log in with Facebook for sharing purposes
- Rate the recipe
- Search recipe box by genre or search term
- Print recipes to PDF or printer output device
