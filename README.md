# Feed Me
A Dot net MVC application for choosing and saving recipes based on dietary preferences and other search criteria.

###User Story
As a user of this application, when I logon I want to search the API for recipes that align with any dietary restrictions I may have.  Once I choose the any dietary restrictions, I want to further search those results for a subset of requirements i.e. genre of food or ethnic origin.

As a user, when I have selected the type of recipe I desire, I want those recipes to populate a page in the application for me to inspect them and choose which ones I want to further explore.

From the list of recipes returned by the search, I want to be able save those recipes to a database (aka the Recipe Box)

 When I select a recipe from the Recipe Box by clicking on it, I want the recipe to open in a new view where I have the option to either edit the recipe and/or add notes and save those changes if desired or Delete the recipe entirely if it is no longer desired. 

Optional features once MVP is reached.
- Log in with Facebook for sharing purposes
- Rate the recipe
- Search recipe box by genre or search term
- Print recipes to PDF or printer output device
- Ability to drag returned recipes to the Recipe Box or to the trash, etc.
