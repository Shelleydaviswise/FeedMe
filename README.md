# Feed Me
A Dot net MVC application for choosing and saving recipes based on dietary preferences.

###User Story
As a client of this site, when I logon I want to search the API for recipes that align with dietary restrictions.  Once I choose that type of recipe I want, I want to further search those results for a subset of requirements i.e. genre of food or ehtnic origin.

As a user, when I have selected they type of recipe I desire, I want those recipes to populate a place in the DOM for me to inspect them.

After displaying a subset of recipes, I want to be able to select recipes I want to try and save those recipes to a database.  (Recipe Box)

As a user, when I display my selected recipes, I want to be able to tweak the recipe and save changes to the recipe if desired or Delete the recipe if it is not worth saving. 

Optional features once MVP is reached.
- Rate the recipe
- Search recipes by genre or search term
- Print recipes to PDF or printer output device
